A colleague of ours recently asked us about the challenges of doing
"remote work".  Obviously, in the current health environment, a lot of
organizations are considering doing remote work for the first
time. For those of us fortunate enough to be knowledge workers,
working from home is pretty accessible. At Learn Leap Fly, we’ve been
doing remote work since the company started in 2015. We built our
model by borrowing heavily from companies with far more experienced
than us (e.g. [automattic-culture][Automattic], [mozilla-best-practices][Mozilla], [basecamp-how][Basecamp]), and then iterating on
those practices based on our own experiences.

Here are some of the things we've learned, both from the perspective
of remote workers, and the perspective of remote team managers.

## On Culture

Be intentional and deliberate about **fostering your team
culture**. One of the big liabilities of remote work is that it's easy
to lose the human side of interactions. To keep your culture in a
remote work environment, you have to be intentional and actively
foster it.

Culture is what you do, not what you say you do. Culture is made up of
the shared practices that you have in common, and what they reflect
about your values as a team. Do you silently tolerate an in-crowd or
do you actively practice and foster open communication channels that
include everyone on your team? Do you favor extroverts, or do you give
a voice to everyone? Remote work is a great opportunity to reflect on
different ways of working and interacting. Whatever practices you
adopt will inevitably reflect and determine the culture of your team.

We recommend you use the remote work opportunity to be deliberate
about what you value, to document these values, and develop processes
that nurture and reflect the culture that you wish to have in your
organization.


## On Meetings, Synchronous, and Asynchronous communication.

I'd go out on a limb and say that every successful remote-work
organization has a *asynchronous most-of-the-time* communications
culture. That is, if asynchronous means will get the job done, **do it
asynchronously*. This means:

**Don't hold a lot of meetings.** This is a [maker-schedule][general rule of thumb for
  productive work], period. Use remote work as an opportunity to **break your meeting
  habit**, and to develop more productive, asynchronous communications
  habits.

**Recognize the true cost of meetings**. In addition to being hard to schedule (especially across timezones), synchronous meetings far more costly than anyone remembers to think. As Basecamp puts it: “five people in a room for an hour isn't a one hour meeting, it's a **five hour** meeting”.

That said, **face-time is important**. Learn Leap Fly has one regular
meeting--the weekly standup--held every Monday. It's easy to start
feeling a lonely and isolated without laying eyes on your coworkers
once in a while.

If you do want to hold synchronous meetings (sparingly!), here's our advice:

* **Share the agenda in advance**. For regular meetings with a set
    agenda (e.g. Sprint Rollovers) it's sufficient to share the agenda
    once. We keep them on our wiki, and evolve them over time as we
    need to.
* Use the **highest quality audio and video platform** you can
  afford.. We use zoom (which has easily the best multi-party video
  quality).
* Make sure **everyone has good quality headphones and mics**.
* **Connect from someplace quiet**. No coffee shops. In a pinch, use a
    car, or even a closet. (but please, don't use a bathroom. that's
    just... weird.)
* **Use one screen per person**. Even if more then one person happens
    to be working from the same space, require everyone to have an
    individual connection to the video chat. This puts everyone on the
    same footing. There's nothing worse than watching an off-camera,
    hard-to-hear conversation from across a bad quality
    video-feed. One screen per person levels the playing field,
    letting everybody **feel like an equal contributor**, regardless
    of whether they are remote or local.

## On Email, Blogs, and Wikis

**Don't use email** for internal business communication. Just
  don't. Use it to communicate with those outside your business if you
  must, but use an **asynchronous messaging tool** (e.g. Slack, Skype
  for Business, Basecamp) for conversations, and a **documentation
  platform** (e.g. blogs, wikis) for more permanent team
  communications.

**Write things down**. [basecamp-how][Basecamp likes to say]:
  "Speaking only helps who’s in the room, writing helps everyone.”
  Think about the people who couldn't make it to a meeting, future
  employees or contractors, and even **future you**.

**Pick the tools that work for you**. Internal blogs are great for
  more detailed ongoing posts about your work. A Wiki can be great for
  long-form, archived information. Automattic uses a wordpress theme
  called P2 to merge their chat, checkins, and blog posts into a
  single interface. Atlassian has confluence. Learn Leap Fly uses
  MediaWiki and Notion. There are lots of options.

**Record daily check-ins**. It's really easy to lose the serendipitous
  advantages that come from running into each other at the office and
  chatting about what you’re currently working on. The informal and
  unplanned sharing of information is key to productivity and
  creativity of teams. Whether this is jotting down a few notes on the
  corporate wiki every day, or using the wonderful “automatic
  check-in” features of products like Basecamp, set aside a few
  minutes at the end of each work day to share what you have been
  working on with your colleagues.

## Digital Watercoolers.

Work isn't always just about working. Have places where people can
interact and let off steam. At LLF, we have a #feeds channel in slack
so people can share interesting things they’re reading
online. [watercooler][Some companies] have a #watercooler or #random
channel for off-topic chat. The point is, people need to interact
about things that aren’t mainline work (and this is a good thing).



## The Arc of Work

**Work in sprints**, with a specific goal and specific end date. Ours
are either 2 or 3 weeks long, and we identify specific success
criteria to make sure our sprints aren’t overly
ambitious. Whenever we hit these goals, we have a mini-celebration
at the sprint rollover.

**Document your successes, and failures**. We have everyone write up
a sprint report as part of our sprint rollovers. This is a little
post that answers the following questions: What did you set out to
do? What did you actually do? What’s blocking your progress? Are
there any process changes that would help you? What’s your morale
(1-10)?

Organize sprints into **larger arcs**. Ours are roughly 3 months
long, after which we prepare a more detailed summary of what we
accomplished and learned. Basecamp calls these checkins "heartbeats."
The act of reflecting on a larger arc is really, really useful to keep
you from losing the forest in all those daily trees.


## For the Remote Worker

Have a **dedicated personal work space**. Home offices are amazing for
productivity. If you don't have room for an office, create a space
that you only use for working.

Think about **ergonomics**. Invest in a properly set-up desk, a great
chair, monitor stands, and a good keyboard. Companies like Automattic
give stipends for home-office setup costs. This is a great way to help
people build a productive and ergonomic home office.

**Get dressed for work**. We don’t mean “dress up.” We mean, “get
changed out of your pajamas”. Having a transition from your “home day”
to your “work day” is important. We've heard of people that will go to
a coffee shop first thing, read the paper, and then come back to their house
to start their work day. Whatever works for you, try and establish a
routine around starting, and stopping work for the day.

**Have dedicated work hours**. This is as much for other people as it is
for you. Plan when you are going to start, when you are going to stop,
and communicate these times with everyone who needs to know them. At
Learn Leap Fly, we use a shared Google calendar for this.

**Speak up!** One of the drawbacks of remote work is that no one can see
you beavering away. Share what you’re doing on the group chat. Post
your daily checkins and weekly updates.

**Stay logged in to the group chat** whenever you are working. For
some reason, seeing that little green dot that tells you other
people are online—even if you’re not actively talking to them—is
super comforting when remote working. Stay present, but don't
constantly check your messages, and get sucked into side
conversations if you're trying to do deep work. Most messaging tools
let you turn on a "Do not disturb" knob that silences notifications
for a while. Use it.

## For the Remote Team Manager

Trust your teammates. One of the first questions we get whenever we talk about remote work arrangements is “what do you do if someone starts slacking off.”  They don’t. The whole magic of a flexible work arrangement is that so long as you are meeting your objectives, we really don’t need to know how you’re doing it. Presumably, you already have mechanisms to review work, with performance reviews and the like. Trust them. if the performance reviews are broken, fix them. In the meantime, trust your teammates.

Don't let your people work too much. Ironically, with all the questions around remote workers slacking off,  it’s working too much that often ends up being the real danger. It's really easy to get sucked in to working too much when you live in your workspace. Keep an eye on your workers. Make it a cultural badge of honour to *not* work more than 40 hours in a week. 

Don't require a fixed work schedule: Let people define the hours that best work for them. Trust them to do the work the way that suits them best, and you’ll be amazed at the results.

Don’t try and replicate the in-person office experience online. In fact, you should use the remote work experience to improve your in-person office work environment. There are a lot of unique advantages to remote work. Take advantage of these advantages. Get your team used to them, and use the change of setting to apply them back to the office setting. One of our favorites is opening up the decision-making process and letting more people in to see how decisions are made in real time. Distributed tools allow everyone to be in the room, not just "management.”

## Tools We Use

No talk of remote work would be complete without mentioning the tools we use. Likely, every remote work scenario will use tools to implement at least the following functions. 

* real-time team chat (e.g. Slack, Skype for Business, Mattermost) 
* Shared Calendar (Basecamp, Google Calendar)
* Videoconferencing (Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype)
* Information (Files, Docs) Repository (e.g. MediaWiki, Notion, Confluence)
* Team Blogging Platform (Confluence, Wordpress)

If you’re a technology shop, you’ll likely also need these:

* Shared Kanban / Sprint boards (Trello)
* Brainstorming Tools (e.g. Miro, Mural)
* Code Repo (GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket) and CI

So what do we use? Here are some of our favourite tool combinations:

slack + mediawiki + zoom + trello + miro + google cal + notion + github/bitbucket

Or:

Basecamp + zoom + slack + github

Or:

Confluence + Bitbucket + Trello


### Tools we use but don’t want to talk about here

* Shared Todo Managers. Actually, we use them all the time, but this level of personal productivity tends to be very personal. We’d recommend you leave this part of the stack up to the individual. (We currently use Nozbe, though we’ve tried Asana and OmniFocus as well.)
* Time tracking and Reporting. We use toggl, if it matters.
* Newsletter tools and CRM tools. We use mailchimp.

## Tools we Don't Use
* Ticketing (e.g. Jira). We’re simply not in that business.  Besides, that’s more of a business function than a remote-work enabler. Ditto for Zendesk
* Single Sign-on. We use a password manager (1password) and generate unique random, strong passwords on every platform we use.
* Corporate email. (Hopefully you’re sold on the virtues of not using email for team communications).
